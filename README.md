fhirball
========
An Express router for persisting [HL7 FHIR](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/) resources in MongoDB. 
Provides a RESTful API that partially implements the FHIR DSTU 1 proposal.
Service configuration is defined using a Conformance resource. 
The server performs only trivial validation - if you post well-formed resources then you can read well-formed resources!

Prerequisites
-------------
Node.js 10+, MongoDB 2.6+

Use
---
To install fhirball:

    $ npm install fhirball
    $ npm install express

To use fhirball create a javascript file and reference express and fhirball packages:

    var express = require('express');
    var fhirball = require('fhirball');

Declare the conformance statement for the server. The conformance statement is parsed on startup and used to generate 
resource interactions and searches. SearchParams have been extended with a non-standard field (document) defining
the document paths to be searched and whether an index should be created to support the search. For example, to create
a Master Patient Index with basic audit capability:

    var conformance = {
        resourceType: 'Conformance',
        publisher: 'Fhirball',
        date: new Date(),
        software: {
            name: 'fhirball',
            version: '0.0.2'
        },
        implementation: {
            description: 'Master Patient Index service',
            url: 'http://127.0.0.1:1337/fhir/'
        },
        fhirVersion: '0.0.82',
        rest: [
            {
                mode: 'server',
                resource: [
                    {
                        type: 'Patient',
                        operation: [
                            {code: 'read'},
                            {code: 'update'},
                            {code: 'delete'},

                            {code: 'search-type'}
                        ],
                        searchParam: [

                                    index: true

                                type: 'token',
                                documentation: 'Gender of the patient',
                                document: {

                                }
                            }
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        type: 'SecurityEvent',
                        operation: [
                            {code: 'read'},
                            {code: 'create'},

                        ],
                        searchParam: [
                        ]
                    }
                ]

            }
        ]
    };

Declare fhirball options, a mongodb connection string, the conformance statement and the content-type (currently must
be application/json)

    var options = {
        db: 'mongodb://localhost/fhirball-demo',
        conformance: conformance,
        'content-type': 'application/json'
    };

Create and start app using fhirball router to provide FHIR api:
    
    var app = express();
    app.use('/fhir/', new fhirball.Router(options));

    //start the app
    app.listen(1337);
    console.log(conformance.implementation.description,'listening for requests on port 1337');

Test
----
To execute unit tests:

    npm install
    mocha --recursive ./test/spec

To execute integration tests, performing CRUD operations on each sample resource:

    mocha --recursive ./test/e2e

Integration tests assume a mongod instance running on localhost.
